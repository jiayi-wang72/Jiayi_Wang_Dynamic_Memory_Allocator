# Jiayi_Wang_Dynamic_Memory_Allocator
An implementation of dynamic memory allocator in C

## Intro
* Independently constructed a 64-bit struct-based dynamic storage allocator consisted of the malloc, free, realloc, and calloc
functions.
* Accomplished 74% utilization and 9000 KOPS throughput by implementing memory block coalescing functions including
implicit list, explicit list, and segmented circular list; eliminated footers in allocated blocks.
* Further optimized allocation by using fitting algorithms; developed test functions on the heap data structure.

## Note
This repo only contains the implementation without the auxiliary helper functions provided as starter code due to privacy reason.
